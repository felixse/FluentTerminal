## How to install (as an end-user)

### Prerequisite
- You need to update to Fall Creators Update or later.

### Chocolatey package manager installation

- Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
- From an elevated/admin shell, execute `choco install fluent-terminal`

### Bundled install script

- Download and extract the latest [release](https://github.com/felixse/FluentTerminal/releases).
- If not already present, download [`Install.ps1`](Install.ps1) to the extracted directory.
- Right-click on `Install.ps1`, and choose "Run with Powershell".
- The installer script will walk you through the rest of the process.

### Manual install

- Download the latest [release](https://github.com/felixse/FluentTerminal/releases)
- [Enable sideloading apps](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-enable-windows-10-sideload-apps-outside-store)
  - Alternatively, [enable developer mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) if you plan to do UWP app development. **For most users that do not intend to do UWP app development, developer mode will not be necessary.**
- Install the *.cer file into `Local Machine` -> `Trusted Root Certification Authorities`
  - This will require administrator elevation. If you installed the certificate and did not have to elevate, you likely installed it into an incorrect certificate store.

![Right-Click then choose Install Certificate](Screenshots/right-click_install-certificate.png)
