## How to install

- [Enable sideloading apps](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-enable-windows-10-sideload-apps-outside-store)
  - Alternatively, [enable developer mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) if you plan to do UWP app development. **For most users that do not intend to do UWP app development, developer mode will not be necessary.**
- Install the *.cer file into `Local Machine` -> `Trusted Root Certification Authorities`
- double click the *.appxbundle
- **Optional:** Install Context menu integration from [here](https://github.com/felixse/FluentTerminal/tree/master/Explorer%20Context%20Menu%20Integration)

## How to build

- Grab the [latest NodeJS 8.x installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and install ensuring that both NPM and "install into system PATH" are checked during the install process.
- Grab the [latest Visual Studio 2017 Community installer](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) and install (See next section)
- [Enable developer mode in Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development)

### Visual Studio 2017 Configuration

- Under "Workloads" select:
  - Universal Windows Platform development
  - Node.js development (Probably not required, given we installed Node.js separately)
- Under individual components, you'll need to install the following:
  - Git for Windows
  - .NET Core runtime
  - .NET 4.7.1 Targeting Pack
  - Windows SDK 16299 for UWP: C#, VB, JS

### The First Build

- Before opening the solution, open a Powershell terminal, go into the `FluentTerminal.Client` folder and run:
  - `npm install` (Ignore the warnings related to `fluent-terminal-client`)
  - `npm run build`
- When the solution is first opened, it will help to set the architecture to x64 for testing, as we didn't install the ARM cross-compiling stuff for VS2017 and we only include pre-compiled winpty binaries for x86 and x64.
  - **For this reason, the default architecture of "Any CPU" will fail to build, and you will have to choose either x64 or x86**
- When first built, Visual studio will spend a significant amount of time resolving dependencies, and fetching additional components via nuGet. This is normal.
  - If you have done the steps so far correctly, and the build is left as a debug build, then the solution should build and launch when you press F5.

### Subsequent Builds

- If you change the `FluentTerminal.Client` contents (**OR** if you merge or pull changes that resulted in changes to files in that folder),you'll need to re-run the `npm run build` (and `npm install` if you, or the pulled-in changes, change the dependencies).
- The rest of the build process is as usual through Visual Studio.

### Packaging

- To start, copy the `Package.StoreAssociation.xml.dev` to `Package.StoreAssociation.xml`, this will provide a basic StoreAssociation file to use when building the app.
- With the solution open in Visual Studio, you can build a package for your own use by right-clicking on the `FluentTerminal.App` project in the Solution Explorer and choosing `Store->Create App Packages`
- Follow the prompts to create a package for sideloading, and if this is only for your personal use, it is OK to only build the x64 package, and not include the debug (i.e PDB) symbols.
  - Note that your commits with these settings (as well as a newly generated temporary store key) will involve changes to the `FluentTerminal.App.csproj` file, so be careful about that if you plan to submit them for PRs.
- This will produce, if successful, a folder in `FluentTerminal.App\AppPackages` that you can zip up and share. You'll need to follow the same install instructions as when installing a release from the GitHub repo, including installing the certificate and then installing the appxpackage.
